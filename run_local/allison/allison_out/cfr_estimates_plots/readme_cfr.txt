The output files from Allison are used to create cfr_new-noage.csv file. 

The output files of burden estimates in this folder are for Portnoy scenario 4.
Scenario 4  (Portnou provided these values) : New CFRs estimated 2000 to 2030 including PSU- and LSHTM-specific incidence for best case and no vax scenarios

The streamlined CFR file is created for Portnoy scenario 6.
Scenario 6 (To be calculated): New CFRs estimated 2000 to 2018 and CFRs held constant 2018 to 2030 including PSU- and LSHTM-specific incidence for best case and no vax scenarios.

Key output:

* Single CFR file with cfr estimates for various VIMC scenarios and Portnoy scenarios 4 and 6.

* Diagnostic cfr plots
